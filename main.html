    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of the input. An algorithm with better time complexity is more efficient and can handle larger inputs more effectively.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses during its execution. Efficient algorithms aim to optimize Space Complexity while solving problems. For example, an algorithm with a Space Complexity of <i>O(n)</i> uses memory proportional to the input size.</p>
