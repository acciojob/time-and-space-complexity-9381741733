    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. It helps in analyzing how efficient an algorithm is.</p>
    
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses as it runs. A common example is O(n), where memory usage grows linearly with input size.</p>
